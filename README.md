## Music Publishing 3.0

### Problem: Artists aren't fairly paid for their creations

* Contracting rules with mega-distribution platforms
* Accurate reporting and compensations for playcounts
* Costs to add albums to library
* Low percentage royalties

### Problems from consumer's perspective:

* Don't want to use BitTorrent.
* See huge percentages going to Apple, Spotify, not the artists. 

Content producers are stuck between making "deals with the devil" or giving away content for free.

### A technical solution:

* An open-source music publishing platform.
* Playcounts are published on blockchain for anyone to audit.
* As playcounts happen, wealth is automatically distributed to appropriate author.
* Bittorent is the most sustainable and scalable option to share media.
* Seeders can also be compensated for their contributions to the ecosystem.

#### One goal: to have a system as easy to use for the consumer as Spotify. With more ethical foundation / transparent operation.



Content publishers need another option for sharing their work
